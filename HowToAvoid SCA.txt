Since the side channel attack takes advantage of the fact that the amount of cycles by the string_compare function call varies (to avoid the cyles acting against us), one could simply program the function on such a way that they "equalize" the number of cycles used despite the pair of strings given as input. This will consist on "forcing" the string_compare function to use a fixed amount of cycles everytime. To do this, it is enough to just count the cycles that have been taken so far until knowing what to output and compensate them by executing any instruction (like adding 1 to an arbitrary register) for as many times needed so that after outputting in a0, the cycles are exactly the ones desired. This will therefore vanish these cycles differences and eliminate the possibilities of attacker guessing the password through a side channel attack approach.
